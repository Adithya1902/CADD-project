A non-overlapping Mealy sequence detector is a type of finite state machine used in digital circuit design to identify specific sequences of input symbols in a continuous stream. Unlike overlapping detectors, this design waits for the current sequence to complete before initiating the detection of a new occurrence. The detector's outputs are influenced by both the current state and the input symbols, allowing for dynamic response to changes in the input stream. This design is commonly employed in applications such as data communication, where discrete and non-overlapping detection of specific input patterns is crucial for accurate and reliable operation.
