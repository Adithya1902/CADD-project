#Abstract

This study investigates the performance characteristics of overlapping and non-overlapping designs in both Moore and Mealy sequence detectors, focusing on their implications for speed and reliability. Sequence detectors are essential components in digital systems, playing a crucial role in pattern recognition and state transition applications.

#Sequence Detectors

Sequence Detectors are sequential circuits that give an output of 1 when a particular pattern of bits sequentially arrive at the data input.
Sequence Detectors is a good example of a Finite State Machine (FSM).
There are 2 types of FSMâ€™s that we can use to implement a sequence detector. They are Moore and Mealy machines respectively.
Within these 2 types we can classify them as overlapping and non-overlapping

#Overlapping & Non-Overlapping

Overlapping Sequence Detector: In a sequence detector that allows overlap, the final bits of one sequence can be the start of another sequence. For example will be an 1101sequence detector. It raises an output of 1 when the last 4 binary bits received are 1101.
Non-Overlapping Sequence Detector: The sequence detector with no overlap allowed resets itself to the start state when the sequence has been detected. After the initial sequence 1101 has been detected, the detector with no overlap resets and starts searching for the initial 1 of the next sequence.

#Conclusion

With this study we have come to the conclusion that with respect to speed the comparison of speed between these designs depends on various factors, including the specific implementation, technology used, and the requirements of the application. In general, overlapping designs might offer more flexibility and potentially higher clock frequencies, but the actual speed depends on the specific details of the design and the technology in use. It's also worth noting that increasing clock frequency comes with trade-offs, such as increased power consumption and potential signal integrity issues.
