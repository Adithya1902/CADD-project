A Mealy state machine is a type of finite state machine where the outputs depend on both the current state and the inputs. An overlapping Mealy sequence detector is a specific type of Mealy state machine designed to detect a particular sequence of input symbols in a stream, where the sequences may overlap.
The overlapping Mealy sequence detector typically consists of states that represent different stages of the sequence being detected. The transitions between these states are determined by the input symbols, and the outputs are based on both the current state and the inputs. The key characteristic of an overlapping sequence detector is its ability to quickly respond to the start of a new sequence without waiting for the completion of the previous one.
